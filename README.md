## To-Do List

https://a3-benjamin-klaiman.glitch.me/

This application serves as a user-friendly to-do list. Over the course of realizing this application, I had to connect data to an 
external database, tweak the CSS in my chosen framework's liking, and learn how to utilize middleware packages. For this project, 
I used the the Materialize CSS Framework to make the page more user-friendly. In addition, I made several alterations to the 
provided CSS, including making the button rounder to differentiate it from text boxes, and altering the background and font color 
to match a custom color scheme (see Design Achievement 2 below). Five middleware packages were used in this project: body-parser, 
cookie-session, error-handler, multer, and response-time. Body-parser parses incoming requests in a middleware before handlers.
Cookie-session is simple cookie-based middleware which allows user session data to be stored on the server or the client. Error-handler 
is development-only error handler middleware which displays as much information about an error object as possible. Multer is a node.js 
middleware that handles multipart form data. Response-time records the response time for requests in HTTP servers, the elapsed time 
from when a request enters this middleware to when the headers are written out to the client.


### Design Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I used Epilogue and Poppins as the fonts for the primary copy text in my site. 
- **Design Achievement 1.5**: In addition, I used these two as a Google-recommended font pairing.
- **Design Achievement 2**: I tilized a color scheme consisting of shades of blue, a popular color.
